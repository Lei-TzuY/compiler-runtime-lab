# Nova

Nova is an early-stage programming-language project exploring whether one
coherent language can combine fast, readable application development with
predictable native performance and strong safety properties. Its intended
design space includes static typing with inference, explicit optional values,
algebraic data types, typed errors and effects, structured concurrency, and
low-level control through narrowly classified `unsafe` capabilities.

Those are design goals, not current claims. Nova is not production ready. The
current bootstrap can interpret its small checked subset, but it does not yet
implement ownership, effects, concurrency, native code generation, a standard
library, or memory-safety analysis.

## Current status

The repository contains the Phase 0 constitution, the executable Phase 1
frontend, Phase 2 semantic-core slices, and executable Phase 3 bootstrap
interpreter slices. The toolchain is written in Rust and can:

- read a Nova file or standard input while rejecting malformed UTF-8;
- lex the documented v0.1 subset with byte-exact source spans;
- parse functions, explicitly typed anonymous function expressions, recursive explicit function types,
  nominal records and enums, UTF-8 string literals, explicit aggregate construction, exhaustive enum matching with payload discard, field projection,
  initialized bindings, typed delayed `var` initialization, narrow assignments,
  expressions, blocks, calls, `if` expressions, pre-test `while` loops, bare Unit
  returns, and statement-only `break`/`continue`;
- lower accepted syntax into a resolved, typed HIR whose function, closure,
  binding, record, and enum identities are qualified by an explicit owning module,
  with closure capture metadata plus verified callable CFGs;
- resolve top-level functions and nominal types through an explicit per-module
  namespace, plus parameters, lexical local bindings, record-field and enum-variant
  name/slot identities, and match payload bindings;
- check bootstrap `Int`, `UInt`, `Bool`, `String`, `Unit`, the uninhabited `!`
  bottom type, nominal aggregate types, function
  signatures, local inference and annotations, calls, operators, block tails, branches,
  returns, loop conditions, loop-control legality, record construction/projection,
  enum construction, match exhaustiveness and arm types, direct-constructor arm
  usefulness, assignment mutability/type constraints, and CFG-based definite initialization;
- execute semantically accepted programs through a deterministic bootstrap
  interpreter with named functions, typed closures and capture-by-value environments,
  recursion, Unit-valued procedures, records, enums, UTF-8 strings, pattern matching, mutation,
  blocks, conditionals, bounded loops, and structured `break`/`continue`;
- emit structured, coded compile-time and runtime diagnostics rendered as human
  text or JSON Lines, including reachability and match-usefulness warnings;
- print a deterministic debug representation of the parsed AST; and
- emit fail-closed semantic-inspection v1 documents with resolved declarations,
  bindings, types, spans, expression relationships, and exhaustive match facts,
  plus explicitly selected v2 documents that add the verified CFG and v3 documents
  that additionally expose explicit match payload modes without reinterpreting v1/v2 fields,
  v4 documents that extend the program projection with String type/literal categories,
  v5 documents that add closure definitions, captures, callable ownership, and verified closure CFGs,
  v6 documents that expose single-module ownership without inventing import semantics,
  and v7 documents that add the checked `UInt` type, unsigned constants, explicit
  `Int`/`UInt` conversion expressions, and explicit by-value capture mode without
  mutating the frozen v1-v6 contracts.

`nova check` performs lexical, syntactic, name-resolution, bootstrap type, and
definite-assignment validation. `nova run` performs those same checks and then
executes zero-argument `main`. The interpreter is evidence for the executable
subset, not a claim that Nova's final runtime representation, numeric model,
aggregate layout, ABI, or backend is stable.

Semantic warnings do not reject an otherwise valid program. The bootstrap reports
`N3033` when the verified CFG proves that source follows an executable `return`,
`break`, or `continue`, and `N3034` when a direct enum-constructor match scrutinee
proves that an otherwise-valid concrete variant arm can never be selected. Warnings are
written to standard error while `check`, `run`, or `inspect` continues normally. Any
semantic error suppresses these deferred warnings to avoid recovery cascades. For strict
CI, `--fail-on-warnings` makes warning-bearing semantic commands return status `1`
without changing diagnostic severity; it also prevents `run` execution and `inspect`
document output.

The implemented syntax is intentionally small:

```nova
enum Result {
    Empty,
    Value(Int),
}

fn main() -> Int {
    let result = Result::Value(42);
    match result {
        Result::Empty => 0,
        Result::Value(value) => value,
    }
}
```

extend beyond them.

## Current semantic rules

The Phase 2 bootstrap checker predeclares function signatures and nominal record
and enum identities, so forward calls, recursion, forward aggregate type
references, and recursive enum payload types resolve deterministically. A local
initializer is checked before its new binding enters scope, preventing
accidental self-reference. Duplicate names in the same lexical scope are
rejected; nested lexical blocks may shadow outer bindings in this slice.
Function parameters and a function body's outermost bindings share one scope.

The current CLI places each source in one implicit root module. Semantic HIR identities
are nevertheless `(ModuleId, local index)` pairs, and name collection is owned by an
explicit per-module scope. `analyze_in_module` lets a future loader assign another
session-local module identity without deriving meaning from a filename. CFG, interpreter,
and inspection boundaries reject cross-module same-index identity drift. This foundation
does not add module/import syntax, visibility, multi-file linking, or package semantics.

Explicit function types use `fn(T1, T2) -> U` and may nest recursively in any type
position. Named top-level functions and explicitly typed anonymous functions share those
structural callable signatures, so either can be passed, returned, stored in typed locals,
and invoked through values. Anonymous functions use `fn(name: Type, ...) -> Type { ... }`
and capture outer bindings by value in first lexical-use order. Reading an enclosing mutable
`var` takes a creation-time snapshot; later outer assignments do not change that captured value.
Assigning through such a snapshot fails closed as `N3035`; no shared-cell or by-reference mutation
semantics are inferred. Each anonymous-function evaluation creates a distinct closure instance,
while aliases retain that instance identity. Methods and implicit callable conversions remain
outside the bootstrap subset.

`String` is an immutable UTF-8 bootstrap scalar. Literals admit unescaped non-control
Unicode scalar values and the exact escapes `\\`, `\"`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, and `\0`;
invalid escapes, raw control characters, and unterminated or multiline literals fail in
the lexer. String values work in annotations and inference, calls and returns, records and
enums, branches and matches, mutable slots, and `==` / `!=`. Equality compares decoded
scalar sequences after left-to-right evaluation, and closed String values may refine
control-flow proofs without folding retained HIR. Concatenation, indexing, interpolation,
methods, standard-library APIs, allocation, layout, ownership, and ABI remain unspecified.

The surface type `!` exposes the semantic core's existing uninhabited bottom type. A
`fn forever() -> !` signature states that the function has no continuing return path; calls
to such a function therefore fit any expected value position without manufacturing a value.
`!` may appear in any type-reference position, including nested function types, but no
ordinary runtime `Value` can inhabit it. A `-> !` body that falls through or produces a
continuing tail is rejected, while proven non-continuation such as `while true {}` with no
reachable `break` satisfies the contract. Every published semantic-inspection schema
represents Never, so exposing the spelling did not change an inspection schema.

A `Unit`-returning function may now write `return;` as the compact explicit form of
returning Unit. Semantic analysis checks the bare form as `Unit` against the declared
return type, so non-Unit functions receive the same `N3004` mismatch used for an explicit
wrongly typed return expression. AST and HIR retain a bare return separately from
`return ();`; the interpreter produces the ordinary `Value::Unit`, and the existing
function-boundary conformance check still rejects malformed HIR that claims a different
return type. Every published semantic-inspection schema models a return statement with zero child
expressions, so this source distinction needs no schema version bump.

Rejected calls are fail-closed for continuing flow recovery. Callees and arguments
are still lowered left-to-right for deterministic diagnostics, but a non-callable
callee, wrong arity, argument type mismatch, or erroneous argument yields Error HIR
and cannot export assignments or loop-exit facts. An actually evaluated child that
is already non-continuing keeps its `!` flow.

Rejected field access follows the same recovery discipline. The base is evaluated
first, but a continuing non-record base or unknown field yields Error HIR and cannot
export flow facts produced only inside the rejected access. A base that is already
non-continuing keeps `!` without a secondary field-type cascade.

Rejected unary and binary operators are also fail-closed. Concrete operand type
mismatches produce Error HIR rather than a nominal success type, and flow facts from
a continuing rejected operator are rolled back. Non-continuation from an operand that
must be evaluated keeps `!` precedence; short-circuit operators retain their existing
conditional right-hand evaluation rules.

Matching `Int`, `UInt`, `Bool`, `String`, and `Unit` values support `==` and `!=`. `Unit` has a
single runtime value, so Unit equality is always true and Unit inequality is always false
once both operands have evaluated normally. A nominal enum also supports equality when
every declared variant is payload-free; operands must have the same enum identity and
comparison uses the resolved variant slot. Function values are comparable only at the
same fully resolved signature and compare top-level declaration identity. Direct top-level
function-reference HIR retains the source-resolved spelling alongside `FunctionId`; runtime
and semantic-inspection consumers recheck that name/id/signature contract, so malformed HIR
cannot silently retarget a reference to a same-signature sibling declaration. Validated local
aliases still carry only runtime declaration identity rather than source spelling. Enums with
any payload variant and records remain non-comparable. Closed-condition analysis can prove
literal Unit, direct payload-free enum-constructor, and direct function-reference
comparisons; closed String literals and immutable aliases participate as well, while calls
and mutable values remain dynamic and are still evaluated at runtime.

Invalid continuing control conditions are fail-closed too. A non-Bool or erroneous
`if` condition makes the expression Error-typed and discards condition/branch flow
facts; a rejected `while` condition likewise cannot export pre-test initialization or
loop exits. A condition that is already `!` keeps its non-continuation, while valid
Bool conditions retain the established pre-test and branch dataflow rules.

`record Name { field: Type, ... }` declares a nominal type: two separately
declared records are distinct even if their fields have the same shape. Field
names must be unique. `new Name { field: expression, ... }` must initialize every
declared field exactly once with a value of the declared type. Named
initializers may be written in any order, but their expressions evaluate left
to right in written source order. HIR retains each resolved field spelling alongside
the nominal record identity and declaration-order slot without reordering evaluation.
The interpreter and semantic-inspection boundary independently recheck that name/slot
pair, so malformed HIR cannot silently retarget one field to a same-typed sibling while
the stable inspection schema continues to expose its existing declaration field ID.
`value.field` is read-only field projection in this slice. Record equality,
field assignment, layout, and ABI guarantees are not implemented.

Rejected aggregate construction is fail-closed for continuing flow recovery. A
record with an unresolved/non-record target or invalid field shape/type, or an enum
constructor with invalid target/payload shape/type, may still emit deterministic
child diagnostics, but assignments or loop
exits created only inside that rejected continuing expression do not become
post-expression facts. A child that is already non-continuing keeps its `!` flow.

`enum Name { Empty, Value(Type) }` declares a nominal sum type whose variants
carry zero or one payload in this slice. Construction is explicitly qualified as
`Name::Empty` or `Name::Value(expression)`. A `match` scrutinee must have an enum
type, every pattern must name a variant of that same nominal enum, and every
variant must occur exactly once. A payload-bearing arm may bind the payload immutably
for that arm or write `_` to discard it without introducing a binding. Payload-free variants
accept neither form. HIR retains the source-resolved variant spelling/slot and explicit
discard intent, so runtime and inspection trust boundaries reject identity or payload-mode
drift instead of treating a deleted binding as discard. `_` here is not a catch-all arm: a
bare wildcard/default pattern, guards, nested patterns, multi-payload variants, equality for
payload-bearing enums, layout, and ABI guarantees remain unimplemented. Semantic-inspection
v1/v2 deliberately reject discard-bearing matches with `N5001`; explicit v3 adds per-arm
`none`/`bind`/`discard` facts while preserving the older schema meanings.

`let` bindings and function parameters are immutable. `var` bindings may be
assigned with the narrow statement form `name = expression;`. The target must
resolve to a lexical `var`; functions, unknown names, `let` bindings, and
parameters are rejected as assignment targets. The replacement value must keep
the binding's established type. Resolved local/parameter reads and assignment targets
retain the selected declaration's `BindingId`, source spelling, and declaration-name
span in HIR. The declaration span is part of the integrity pair because nested scopes
may legally shadow a binding with the same spelling and type; name/type alone cannot
distinguish those declarations. This metadata does not alter lexical resolution, CFG
binding IDs, or the semantic-inspection schema. Assignment is not an expression and
therefore cannot be chained or embedded in another expression.

A mutable local may also be declared as `var name: Type;` and initialized by a
later assignment. The explicit type is required. Reading such a binding before
it is definitely initialized is diagnostic `N3009`. For `if` expressions with a non-literal condition,
analysis evaluates the branch states independently and keeps a binding
initialized afterward only when every branch that can continue has initialized
it. For a valid exhaustive match with a dynamic scrutinee, the same intersection
rule applies across every arm that can continue. When the scrutinee is a direct,
successfully resolved enum constructor, its variant is already known: only the
selected arm may contribute definite-initialization, non-continuation, or loop-exit
facts. Non-selected arms are still fully checked for pattern validity, static
diagnostics, exhaustiveness, and arm type compatibility. A branch or reachable arm
that returns, breaks, or continues does not constrain a surviving continuation.
Unreachable code is still analyzed for deterministic diagnostics, but its
assignments cannot manufacture reachable definite-initialization facts.
For strict left-to-right expression forms, once an earlier subexpression cannot
continue, later operands, call arguments, or record initializers are likewise
lowered only for diagnostics and cannot create reachable scope or loop-exit
facts.

`&&` and `||` preserve static checking of both operands while modeling their
runtime reachability explicitly. A direct `false && rhs` or `true || rhs` lowers
`rhs` only for diagnostics, so skipped assignments and loop transfers contribute
no reachable flow facts. A direct `true && rhs` or `false || rhs` treats `rhs` as
mandatory. With a dynamic Boolean left operand, `rhs` is optional: post-expression
definite initialization is the intersection of the short-circuit continuation
and every continuing RHS path. An RHS that returns, breaks, or continues therefore
does not make the whole Boolean expression non-continuing when the left operand
can bypass it, although a reachable RHS `break` still remains a possible exit
from its enclosing loop.

A direct `if true` or `if false` refines control-flow reachability without
turning the checker into a general constant folder. Only the selected branch may
contribute definite-initialization, non-continuation, or loop-exit facts; the
unselected branch is still lowered for deterministic static diagnostics and still
participates in branch type compatibility. Block-valued or computed Boolean
conditions keep the ordinary conservative two-branch merge.

`while condition { body }` is a pre-test statement. The condition must be
`Bool`. For an ordinary condition, the body may execute zero times, so
definite-assignment facts established while evaluating the mandatory first
condition test may survive the loop while facts established only inside the body
do not. This preserves the zero-iteration exit rather than manufacturing
initialization evidence.

When the closed-condition evaluator proves a `while` condition true (for example
`true` or the statement-free wrapper `{ true }`), the loop has no condition-false
exit. The checker treats it as guaranteed-entry and records only reachable `break`
transfers that target that exact loop. If there are such exits, a pre-existing
binding is definitely initialized afterward only when it is initialized at every
reachable break exit. If there is no reachable break, the loop is non-continuing.
A `break` consumed by a nested loop does not count as an exit from an outer loop.
This proof changes flow analysis only; the retained HIR is never constant-folded.

`break;` and `continue;` are legal only inside an enclosing `while` body. The
condition expression is intentionally outside that loop-control scope. `break;`
exits the nearest enclosing loop; `continue;` skips the rest of the current
iteration and re-evaluates that same loop's condition. Neither carries a value
or acts as an expression. Labelled loops and value-carrying breaks are not part
of the bootstrap subset.

`Int`, `UInt`, `Bool`, `String`, `Unit`, and declared nominal records and enums are recognized
surface types today. `()` is the sole Unit literal, and a block with no tail also
produces Unit. A function declared `-> Unit` may fall through such a body or use
the explicit `return ();` form; non-Unit functions still need a compatible tail or
an explicit return on every continuing path. Arithmetic and ordered comparisons
require matching `Int` or matching `UInt` operands; unary negation remains `Int`-only.
Boolean operators require `Bool`; equality accepts matching `Int`, `UInt`, `Bool`,
`String`, `Unit`, the same function signature, or
the same nominal payload-free enum type; function equality compares declaration
identity rather than addresses or code layout, and calls require matching arity and
argument types.
`if` conditions require `Bool`, and continuing branches or match arms must remain
type-compatible. The surface `!` bottom type has no ordinary runtime value.

These rules are bootstrap semantics, not a promise that Nova's broader type,
mutation, control-flow, aggregate, and shadowing policies are frozen.

## Bootstrap execution rules

`nova run` requires one top-level `main` with no parameters and an `Int`, `UInt`, `Bool`,
`String`, or `Unit` return type. A Unit-valued `main` prints `()` like any other returned
bootstrap value. Execution evaluates expressions left to
right. Record initializer
expressions follow the same rule even when named fields are written out of
declaration order. `&&` and `||` are short-circuiting, so a skipped right operand
performs no mutation, call, return, or loop transfer. Semantic dataflow follows
that same reachability while still type-checking the skipped source. A match
evaluates its scrutinee exactly once and then only its selected arm.

The interpreter propagates structured control flow through nested blocks,
conditionals, aggregate initializers, call arguments, and selected match arms.
`return` reaches the current function call. `break` and `continue` travel only
to the nearest enclosing `while`; that loop consumes them by exiting or starting
the next condition test. If malformed HIR lets loop control escape its lexical
loop or cross a function boundary, execution fails closed with invariant
diagnostic `N4005` rather than guessing a target.

Function calls also validate the runtime/HIR type boundary. Every argument must
recursively conform to its resolved parameter type, and every returned runtime
value must recursively conform to the function's declared type. A direct top-level
function reference additionally revalidates its retained source spelling against the
referenced declaration's `FunctionId` before producing `Value::Function`; the ordinary
expression postcondition then independently checks the declaration signature against
the reference HIR type. Local aliases receive only that already-validated runtime
identity. Nominal record and enum identities, record slots, and enum payloads are
checked rather than trusted from their outer value tag alone. Valid semantically
produced HIR is unaffected; malformed or contract-drifted HIR fails closed with `N4005`.

Aggregate construction enforces the same invariant locally: each evaluated record
field must conform to its declaration slot type, and each enum payload must conform
to its selected variant payload type before the aggregate value is created. Record
construction and projection also revalidate the HIR-resolved field spelling against
its declaration-order slot, closing same-typed member-retargeting drift that a type
postcondition alone cannot observe. Enum construction and matching apply the analogous
variant spelling/slot check after payload or scrutinee evaluation has produced an ordinary
value, preserving structured return/break/continue propagation before value-only invariant
validation. These checks catch malformed HIR even when the aggregate never crosses a
function boundary.

Runtime frames preserve the resolved binding contract too. Each slot records its
resolved type, mutability, initialization state, declaration spelling, and declaration
span. Parameters, local bindings, delayed `var` declarations, and match payload bindings
reject non-conforming initial values or incompatible reuse of one binding identity;
repeated execution of the same lexical binding may refresh its slot only with identical
type/mutability/name/span metadata. Binding reads revalidate the retained HIR reference
against that slot before checking expression type and stored runtime-value conformance,
so even same-name, same-type shadow retargeting fails closed. Assignment evaluates its
RHS first; only an ordinary produced value triggers target identity, mutability, and
replacement-type validation, preserving structured `return`/`break`/`continue` precedence.
Any such interpreter/HIR drift fails closed with `N4005`.

Every block and expression that completes with an ordinary runtime value also has a
final interpreter postcondition: the value must recursively conform to that node's
typed-HIR result type. Block checking includes function bodies, selected conditional
branches, and executed loop bodies even when their result is discarded. Runtime
conformance first validates the resolved type itself:
nominal record/enum names must still match their declaration IDs, and function
signatures recursively apply the same rule to parameter and return types. This closes
a malformed-HIR gap where a record or enum value with the correct nominal ID could
previously satisfy a drifted `Type::Record`/`Type::Enum` spelling. The same entry gate
therefore protects local or discarded literals, projections, operators, blocks,
conditionals, matches, call boundaries, frame storage, and aggregate nesting without
changing the compact runtime value representation. Equality adds an operator-level
precondition on ordinary value-producing paths as well: when both operands can complete
normally, their resolved types must satisfy the same shared semantic comparability rule,
including the declaration-wide payload-free requirement for enums. Malformed HIR therefore
cannot compare a payload-free variant of an enum whose other variants carry payloads.
A `Never` operand still evaluates normally for structured `return`, `break`, or `continue`
propagation and never reaches the comparison itself. Structured transfers likewise bypass
block and expression value postconditions until their owning function or loop consumes
them. Any interpreter/HIR contract drift on a value-producing path fails closed with
`N4005`.

For deterministic execution while the numeric design remains provisional, integer
literals may be decimal or use binary (`0b`/`0B`), octal (`0o`/`0O`), or hexadecimal
(`0x`/`0X`) prefixes, with single `_` separators between digits. Lexing validates the
selected radix and erases the source spelling after decoding every accepted form to the
same checked magnitude. Positive `Int` literals end at `2^63 - 1`; magnitude `2^63`
in any supported radix is reserved for prefix negation, so both
`-9223372036854775808` and `-0x8000_0000_0000_0000` normalize to exact `Int::MIN`.
Positive magnitude `2^63` is `N3030`; larger magnitudes are lexical `N1004`. The
interpreter represents `Int` as signed 64-bit at runtime and uses checked arithmetic.
Signed division truncates the quotient toward zero; a non-zero remainder has the
same sign as the dividend and satisfies `a = (a / b) * b + (a % b)`. Both
`i64::MIN / -1` and `i64::MIN % -1` are classified as integer overflow. Before
execution, semantic analysis also preflights reachable deterministic arithmetic through
a side-effect-free closed-HIR proof engine: statically certain overflow is `N3031` and
a statically certain zero divisor is `N3032`. Literal arithmetic remains the simplest
case, but the proof can also carry immutable closed `let` bindings through blocks,
selected `if`/`match` values, selected enum payload bindings, record projections, and
closed Bool/Unit/enum/function identity. Checked selector, aggregate, and composite-value
boundaries preserve a deterministic arithmetic failure instead of degrading it to an
unknown proof. Source lowered only for diagnostics because control flow proves it
unreachable does not manufacture these execution-failure diagnostics.

Execution-failure collection is statement-aware without making statements closed values.
Initialized bindings and expression statements are scanned in source order; assignment RHS
values, potentially executable `while` conditions and bodies, and value-bearing `return`
expressions are inspected using the closed/static facts available at that program point.
Delayed `var` declarations and ordinary assignments remain continuing but do not create new
closed facts; an assignment RHS typed `!` or a `return`, `break`, or `continue` statement
stops collection after the corresponding noncontinuing transfer. A proven-true `while`
continues scanning its successor only when the body has a reachable `break` targeting that
loop; breaks consumed by nested loops, statically unselected breaks, and loop-exit facts
inside rejected expressions do not create a false successor.

The same proof engine may refine `if`, `while`, short-circuit, and closed `match`
reachability without folding retained HIR. Analyzer-side structural summaries are a
separate, weaker fact system: immutable enum/record aliases and selected paths may retain
a known enum variant or known record-field tags even when a payload or unrelated sibling
is dynamic, but those tag facts never promote the dynamic payload/value itself to a
constant. Calls, mutable bindings, assignment/loop/control-transfer effects, and genuinely
dynamic operands stop the closed-value proof and remain runtime evaluated. A dynamic
selector is different from a dynamic arithmetic operand: when a valid continuing `if`
condition or `match` scrutinee is unknown, every potentially executable branch or arm is
still inspected for deterministic arithmetic failures that depend only on closed facts
already available outside that selector. This does not close the selector or any dynamic
payload binding. More generally, when an `if`/`while` condition or `match` scrutinee is already
non-continuing (`!`), its successor branches/body/arms are lowered only for static
diagnostics: execution-only constant failures and flow mutations cannot come from a
path runtime control never reaches. Successful constant arithmetic is not folded, and
any expression with a dynamic operand remains runtime checked. Such
dynamic overflow produces `N4002`; dynamic division or remainder by zero produces
`N4003`. The arithmetic truth table itself lives once in the dependency-free
`nova-int-semantics` leaf crate; semantic preflight supplies only closed-HIR traversal
and the interpreter supplies only runtime diagnostic mapping. This keeps both layers
on one checked signed-64 contract rather than duplicating host-edge-case policy.
Recursive execution is guarded by a finite active-call budget
and reports `N4004`. All statement/expression evaluation also shares a finite
execution-step budget; a nonterminating loop therefore reports `N4006` instead
of hanging indefinitely. Missing or invalid `main` is `N4001`. Record values
currently use declaration-order slots; enum values use a variant slot and an
optional boxed payload. Those interpreter-owned nominal representations are not
stabilized source layouts, allocation promises, ownership rules, or ABI
contracts.

`UInt` is a distinct unsigned 64-bit family. Unsuffixed literals still default to
`Int`; `UInt::MIN` and `UInt::MAX` expose `0` and `2^64 - 1`, and
`UInt::from(Int)` / `Int::from_uint(UInt)` are the only implemented cross-family
conversions. Same-family `UInt` arithmetic is checked, mixed-family operators are
type errors, and failed conversions report `N4007` instead of wrapping or saturating.

## Build and use

Nova declares Rust 1.85 as its bootstrap minimum and also tracks current stable
Rust in CI. With Rust and Cargo installed:

```console
cargo build --workspace
cargo run -p nova-cli -- check examples/basics.nv
cargo run -p nova-cli -- run examples/basics.nv
cargo run -p nova-cli -- run examples/strings.nv
cargo run -p nova-cli -- ast examples/basics.nv
cargo run -p nova-cli -- inspect examples/enums.nv --format json
cargo run -p nova-cli -- inspect examples/enums.nv --format json --schema-version 2
cargo run -p nova-cli -- inspect examples/strings.nv --format json --schema-version 4
cargo run -p nova-cli -- inspect examples/closures.nv --format json --schema-version 6
printf 'fn main() -> UInt { UInt::MAX }\n' | cargo run -p nova-cli -- inspect - --format json --schema-version 7
printf 'fn main() -> Int { 42 }\n' | cargo run -p nova-cli -- check - --source-name scratch/main.nv
```

The `run` command prints the returned value from `main`.

Machine-readable diagnostics are available without changing the compiler's
internal diagnostic model:

```console
cargo run -p nova-cli -- run examples/broken.nv --message-format json
```

The installed binary is named `nova`:

```text
nova check [--source-name name] [--message-format human|json] [--fail-on-warnings] [--] <file|->
nova run [--source-name name] [--message-format human|json] [--fail-on-warnings] [--] <file|->
nova ast [--source-name name] [--message-format human|json] [--] <file|->
nova inspect --format json [--schema-version 1|2|3|4|5|6|7] [--source-name name] [--message-format human|json] [--fail-on-warnings] [--] <file|->
```

Each command accepts exactly one source operand. A filesystem path retains its written
display name; `-` reads standard input to EOF and uses the stable display name `<stdin>` in
human diagnostics, JSON Lines, and semantic-inspection documents. Both inputs pass through
the same UTF-8 and compiler pipeline. Pipelines and editor integrations may give stdin a
non-empty, single-line UTF-8 display name with `--source-name name` or
`--source-name=name`. The option is invalid for filesystem input, and the supplied value is
presentation metadata only: Nova neither reads nor canonicalizes it as a path or URI.
Before the source operand, `--` ends option parsing. The next token is then interpreted as
the source even when it begins with `-`, allowing invocations such as
`nova run -- --program.nv`. No token after the terminator is treated as an option, and the
exact operand `-` retains its standard-input meaning.

Exit status `0` means the requested operation succeeded, `1` means the source or
execution was rejected, and `2` means the command line was invalid. `nova ast`
intentionally stops after parsing, so it can inspect a syntactically valid AST
even when `nova check` or `nova run` would reject that program later.
`nova inspect` instead requires the complete semantic pipeline to succeed and
writes no partial document when source diagnostics or an inspection invariant
failure occurs. Non-fatal warnings are written to standard error without changing
status `0`, runtime output, or a successful inspection document. Schema v1 remains
the default; v2 through v7 must be requested explicitly. A program containing `UInt`
or a mutable-source snapshot capture requires v7; older representationally incomplete
schemas fail closed with `N5001` rather than silently changing their contracts.
With `--fail-on-warnings`, semantic
warnings instead produce status `1` while retaining warning severity; `run` and `inspect`
suppress their ordinary standard output. The option is invalid with `ast`, which does not
perform semantic analysis.

## Bootstrap architecture

```text
source bytes
  -> nova-source        source identity, UTF-8 text, spans, locations
  -> nova-lexer         tokens and lexical diagnostics
  -> nova-parser        AST and syntactic diagnostics
  -> nova-sema          typed HIR, verified CFG, resolution, typing, dataflow
      -> nova-inspect       versioned facts and fail-closed JSON projection
      -> nova-interpreter   deterministic checked, bounded HIR execution

nova-int-semantics      dependency-free checked signed-64 arithmetic truth table
nova-cli                check/run/ast/inspect orchestration and presentation

nova-diagnostics        shared structured diagnostic model and renderers
```

Crate boundaries follow semantic responsibilities rather than intended future
compiler passes. Later work can deepen HIR, inference, effects, MIR, layout, and
backends without making the AST, interpreter, or CLI the owner of unfinished
language semantics.

## Engineering policy

- Unsupported constructs are errors; the compiler does not approximate them.
- Every implemented semantic, syntactic, or execution rule requires
  deterministic tests.
- Source positions are UTF-8 byte ranges internally and one-based line/column
  locations when rendered.
- Runtime arithmetic is checked; host build mode never decides Nova results.
- Observable evaluation order is explicit; named record fields do not reorder
  their initializer expressions, and a match evaluates only its selected arm.
- Short-circuit reachability in semantic flow must agree with runtime `&&`/`||`
  execution while skipped source remains statically checked.
- Non-continuing control-flow paths cannot contribute definite-assignment or loop-
  exit facts to code they cannot reach.
- Non-fatal unreachable warnings are derived from verified CFG edges, not from a
  parallel lexical reachability flag, and never turn accepted HIR into a rejection.
- Function CFGs are verified before publication; `N3009` is produced by their
  fixed-point must analysis rather than ad-hoc diagnostic emission during name lookup.
- Definite initialization has no parallel lexical Boolean: binding HIR preserves the
  declared type while CFG read/initialize events exclusively own flow validity.
- Machine-readable semantics cross a separately versioned schema boundary;
  debug AST/HIR output is never silently promoted into a tooling contract.
- Potentially nonterminating bootstrap execution is bounded and fails with a
  structured diagnostic rather than intentionally hanging the host.
- CI checks Rust 1.85 compatibility, rejects formatting and Clippy warnings on
  current stable, and runs all tests, builds, and rustdoc.
- Roadmap status is evidence-based; planned properties are not reported as
  implemented guarantees.

The staged implementation plan is in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

## Contributing

Keep changes focused and pair grammar, semantic, or runtime changes with
specification updates, positive tests, and negative tests. Prefer a small
end-to-end slice over disconnected scaffolding for several future phases.
