# Bootstrap Control-Flow Contract

This document specifies the function-level control-flow graph (CFG) implemented
by `nova-sema`. It is a compiler contract for the current executable subset, not
a stable serialization format, MIR, backend IR, or promise about future public
compiler APIs.

## Purpose and boundary

The analyzer builds one CFG per HIR function while it lowers source. Building
the graph during lowering is deliberate: rejected aggregate/operator/call paths
and statically skipped source may lose executable HIR structure, but Nova must
still retain those paths for deterministic diagnostics without exporting their
facts into reachable continuation.

The graph exclusively owns definite-initialization state and diagnostic `N3009`.
A resolved binding read keeps the binding's declared HIR type even when CFG analysis
later rejects that read as maybe uninitialized. Type checking and flow checking are
therefore orthogonal: an independently ill-typed use may report its ordinary type
diagnostic alongside `N3009`, rather than relying on a hidden inline initialization
bit to turn the read into recovery `<error>`.

CFG data is exposed as a read-only Rust model on `AnalysisOutput`. It remains
absent from semantic-inspection schema v1; explicitly selected schema v2 projects
the verified graph through a separate tooling-owned model without declaring the
Rust representation or a backend IR stable.

## Graph shape

Each graph has one `Entry`, zero or one normal `Exit` in the current structured
lowerer, and deterministic graph-local node identities. Nodes represent:

- branch-path entry and continuation joins;
- binding initialization and resolved binding reads;
- `return`, `break`, and `continue` transfers; and
- normal function completion.

Predecessor edges are recorded on each node. `Execution` edges represent a
possible reachable continuation, `Diagnostic` edges retain statically checked
source whose facts are discarded before reachable continuation, and `Backedge`
edges return loop fallthrough or `continue` to the pre-test condition header.
Closed side-effect-free condition refinements for `if`, `while`, and
short-circuit operators, direct enum-constructor match selection, and
non-continuing discriminators use diagnostic edges for successors that cannot
execute. Closed-value reasoning may look through a nested block only when that
block contains no statements: its tail must itself be a closed Bool, Int, Unit,
or directly known payload-free enum value, while an empty statement-free block
is the closed Unit value. The original block HIR is retained. Any statement in
the block stops this structural proof without attempting purity analysis, and
calls, binding reads, or other dynamic leaves remain runtime-evaluated.

An invalid construct may leave a reachable-from-entry diagnostic subgraph with
no continuation edge. This is intentional: rollback moves the lowering cursor
back to the last valid state, but does not erase source events or binding
identities needed for diagnostics.
A `while` whose condition is rejected as non-`Bool` may likewise retain body
nodes for static and lexical loop-control diagnostics, but that recovery-only
body is not an executable loop iteration. Neither ordinary body fallthrough nor
a retained `continue` receives a `Backedge` successor to the condition header;
rejected control flow must not reconnect discarded recovery paths to reachable
continuation.

## Verification

Before a graph becomes part of `AnalysisOutput`, the verifier rejects it unless:

- the callable owner, every flow binding, and every binding read/initialize event
  carry the same `ModuleId`, so a foreign same-index binding cannot alter dataflow;
- entry and predecessor identities are in range;
- the designated graph entry is the unique `Entry`-kind node, keeping the solver's
  empty-lattice root aligned with the graph model;
- node identities equal their deterministic vector positions;
- only the entry lacks predecessors; every non-`Join` node has exactly one predecessor,
  making `Join` the only legal merge point for multiple incoming paths;
- each node's predecessor list contains no duplicate source/edge-class pair, keeping
  the graph representation canonical before fixed-point dataflow or tooling projection;
- every node is graph-reachable from the entry, including diagnostic source;
- every node reachable from entry without crossing a `Diagnostic` edge has only
  non-diagnostic predecessors that are themselves reachable on such executable flow;
- binding metadata identities are strictly increasing, making the table canonical and
  preventing duplicate identities from being silently overwritten during dataflow;
- every read/initialization event names graph binding metadata;
- the normal-exit table contains each `Exit` node exactly once and no other node;
- every declared normal exit is executable-reachable and every `Exit` is terminal;
- `return`, `break`, and `continue` successor edge classes respect their transfer
  behavior; in particular, an executable successor of `break` must be a compiler-created
  `Join`, so a loop exit cannot bypass the continuation merge while diagnostic-only
  unreachable source may still follow the transfer through `Diagnostic` edges;
- every `Backedge` targets an executable-reachable `Join` node and originates on the
  same executable flow, so loop cycles cannot be attached to arbitrary nodes or live
  only inside diagnostic recovery;
- every `Join` that receives a `Backedge` also retains at least one earlier `Execution`
  predecessor, preserving the loop's first-entry path in the fixed-point intersection
  instead of allowing backedge-only loop headers to erase pre-iteration facts;
- `Execution` and `Diagnostic` edges point strictly from lower to higher graph-local
  node identities, while every `Backedge` points strictly from a higher identity to an
  earlier loop-header `Join`, making the edge class the only legal encoding of a cycle;
  and
- a syntactic parent transfer does not append an execution node when evaluating its
  child expression has already transferred control.

An internal verification failure is fail-closed diagnostic `N3999`; no invalid
graph is published for that function.
The verifier computes this executable-reachability set independently of lowering.
This makes diagnostic isolation a graph invariant rather than an analyzer convention:
a discarded recovery subtree may branch away from executable flow, but it cannot feed
an executable join, exit, or loop header through any edge class. The fixed-point
must-analysis can therefore safely intersect every recorded predecessor without
allowing recovery-only facts to constrain reachable continuation.
Normal completion has a similarly closed contract. `normal_exits` is not advisory
metadata: it must exactly enumerate the graph's `Exit` nodes without duplicates, each
such node must belong to executable-reachable flow, and an `Exit` has no successor of
any edge class. A diagnostic-only recovery path therefore cannot be mislabeled as a
successful function completion, and post-exit diagnostic nodes cannot extend a graph
past its terminal boundary.

## Unreachable-code warning query

After all graphs and semantic errors have been resolved, accepted analysis reuses
the verifier's executable-edge interpretation for non-fatal diagnostic `N3033`.
For every execution-reachable `return`, `break`, or `continue` node, the query
examines direct `Diagnostic` successors and reports the earliest source span at
most once. The transfer span is retained as a secondary label explaining why
the selected region cannot execute.

Diagnostic-only transfers never produce nested warnings, and any semantic error
suppresses the warning pass. This keeps statically checked recovery source in the
graph without cascading one warning from another unreachable region. The query
does not currently warn for every node outside executable reachability: constant-
selected branches and loops remain outside this deliberately narrow policy.

## Definite-initialization dataflow

For binding set `B`, the solver starts non-entry nodes at `B` and iterates
downward to a fixed point. For each node `n`:

```text
IN[entry] = {}
IN[n]     = intersection(OUT[p] for each predecessor p)
OUT[n]    = IN[n] union {b}   when n initializes b
OUT[n]    = IN[n]             otherwise
```

A read of `b` is accepted only when `b` belongs to `IN` at that read. Starting
from the binding universe computes the conservative must-analysis fixed point;
the function-entry path prevents loop-only initialization from becoming a fact
on a zero-iteration exit. Parameters and initialized declarations create
explicit initialization nodes. A successful, mutable, type-correct assignment
does the same.

Diagnostic-only reads are still checked and can produce `N3009`, matching Nova's
policy that unreachable source receives deterministic static diagnostics.
Diagnostic-only initialization nodes remain confined to discarded paths and are
never joined into a reachable continuation by the structured builder.

## Deliberate limitations

The CFG currently carries only facts needed for local definite initialization.
It does not encode value SSA, dominance, liveness, borrow/region facts, effects,
exceptions, async suspension, pattern usefulness, optimization legality, or
backend blocks. Loop reasoning remains the documented bootstrap rule: ordinary
pre-test loops preserve the zero-iteration path, while a side-effect-free closed
condition proven true may continue only through reachable `break` exits.

Statement-free block transparency is intentionally structural rather than a purity
analysis. The evaluator may recurse through zero-statement block tails while proving
closed Bool/Int expressions, Unit values, or direct payload-free enum constructors,
but it never removes those blocks from HIR. A single statement stops the proof even
when that statement appears harmless. The evaluator does not execute calls, follow
names, inspect mutable state, or infer that arbitrary same-typed expressions are
constant; those cases remain runtime-evaluated.

Additional flow-sensitive checks should migrate onto explicit analyses only when
each has a specified lattice, verifier invariants, and adversarial tests; lexical
resolution and HIR typing must not grow parallel hidden flow facts again.
